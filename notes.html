<h1> A bit about the internet</h1>

<h2>URL</h2>

<p>URL stands for <em>Uniform Resource Locator</em>. It contains serveral different parts, including:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>protocol</strong>: e.g. http, https, ftp</li>
<li>the <strong>host</strong>: e.g. <a href="http://www.facebook.com"> www.facebook.com</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk"> www.bbc.co.uk</a></li>
<li>the <strong>path</strong>: e.g. /news/local, /john.smith.95</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>DNS</h2>

<p>DNS stands for Domain Name System. You buy a domain name from a registrar (e.g. 123-reg, GoDaddy). They arrange for your server's IP address to be added next to the domain name on a DNS server, so that people can find your site. This process can take a couple of days to spread out over the entire internet, as DNS servers take time to update one another using a 'gossiping' mechanism.</p>

<h2>Server-side vs. Client-side technologies</h2>

<h3> Client-side </h3>

Client-side technologies run in your web browser (e.g Firefox, Google Chrome or Internet Explorer). The three main client-side technologies are:

<ol>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
</ol>

<h3>Server-side</h3>

Server-side technologies run on the server. There are many more possibilities here.
